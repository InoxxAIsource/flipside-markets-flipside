## Performance Tracking Sheet

### Metrics to Track Per KOL:

| KOL Name | Cost | Tweet Date | Impressions | Clicks | Signups | Users (30d) | CPA | ROI |
|----------|------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Example | $500 | 2024-12-01 | 50,000 | 2,500 | 150 | 45 | $11.11 | 2.8x |

**Success Criteria:**
- CPA < $15 = Great
- CPA $15-30 = Okay
- CPA > $30 = Don't renew

---

## Negotiation Tips

### Starting the Conversation:
1. **Don't lead with price** - Show the product first
2. **Offer product value** - $500 USDT to trade + early access
3. **Ask their rate** - Let them name price first
4. **Counter at 50-70%** - Always negotiate down

### Payment Structure:
**Option A: Flat Fee**
- $X upfront for 1 thread + 2 retweets

**Option B: Performance Bonus**
- $X base + $5 per signup (capped at $Y)
- Better for you, harder to sell to them

**Option C: Token Allocation**
- $X cash + $Y in FLIP tokens (vested)
- Only works if you have tokenomics ready

### Red Flags During Negotiation:
❌ Won't send past campaign metrics  
❌ Demands 100% upfront (offer 50% upfront, 50% after posting)  
❌ Can't explain your product back to you  
❌ Wants to write content without your review  

---
